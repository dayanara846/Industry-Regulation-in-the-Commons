# Industry-Regulation-in-the-Commons
For my ECON 7710 (Microeconomic Theory 2) I co-authored a short paper that tackled The Tragedy of the Commons game, from the firm's point of view, with a new approach.

To see the theoretical outcome of this game for different industry sizes, I wrote a code ("Game_output.R") that estimates the payoffs, best responses and equilibriums of each firm. The results of this code are in the file "Game-Output.pdf".

To see the empirical outcome of this game for different industry sizes, my research team and I will do an experiment with 10-15 students at our university. Each of the students will be tasked with the role of a firm in this game, were all of them will be asked to provide their responses simulatenously and without cooperation. 

To see the game setup, you may refer to the LateX document ".pdf"
