# Industry-Regulation-in-the-Commons
For my ECON 7710 (Microeconomic Theory 2) I co-authored a short paper that tackled The Tragedy of the Commons game, from the firm's point of view, with a new approach.

To see the theoretical outcome of this game for different industry sizes, I wrote the package "gamepaper" that provides the structure and estimates the payoffs, best responses and equilibriums of each firm for a given industry size. 

To see the empirical outcome of this game for different industry sizes, my research team and I will do an experiment with 10-15 students at our university. Each of the students will be tasked with the role of a firm in this game, were all of them will be asked to provide their responses simulatenously and without cooperation. 

To see the whole R script, R Markdown and LaTeX Appendix derived from the R Markdown, please refer to my other repository: "Industry Size Regulation in the Commons".
